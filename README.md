# 🎮 Echoes of Rampage: A Cinematic 2D Platformer Built in Godot

> _“No more hiding... it’s time to light up the storm.”_

**Echoes of Rampage** is a story-driven 2D platformer created entirely in **Godot Engine**.  
With handcrafted transitions, phase-based boss fights, ambient music layering, and atmospheric storytelling — it's a journey through the chaos that's been left behind… or is yet to come.

## 🧪 Development Journey

Every mechanic, animation sync, and scene transition was learned, broken, and rebuilt through **pure iteration and experimentation**.

What started with just spawning slimes… turned into a full cinematic game loop.

> “They came in waves. And when the waves were over, something greater rose from their echoes...”
