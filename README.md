## 🧠 Developer’s Note

This wasn’t built using any template or tutorial.  
Every mechanic — from music fade logic to boss resurrection — was a result of deep exploration, iteration, and problem-solving.

The game evolved with every experiment:
- `Tween` and `AnimationPlayer` were mastered for transitions.
- Audio issues led to understanding the difference between `AudioStreamPlayer` and `AudioStreamPlayer2D`.
- Multiple levels of polish were applied to pacing, parkour, and payoff.

This game was **built with heart, line by line.**
